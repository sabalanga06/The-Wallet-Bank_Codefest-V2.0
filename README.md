# The-Wallet-Bank_Codefest-V2.0


## Web Design Problem :3
Design a web page as shown in the image. You can choose colours using a colour picker or similar tools, and get the nearest fonts as used in the image. You can find similar stock photos from popular platforms like freepik, pexels, unsplash etc or any of your choice.


## Task
You have to create a 1-page website.

The website must have a navigation menu which can redirect to the appropriate section. 

The website is for the wallet bank, so feel free to use animations.

The website must be Mobile friendly.

There should be the text “Call Now” which should redirect to the Call Screen when clicked from a Mobile Phone.

“Lorem ipsum..” can be used for long descriptions.

You can put any values for the given points to be added on the website. For example, you should create Random Text testimonials.

You can use any CSS frameworks you like.
